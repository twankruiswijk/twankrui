I also leveraged NextJS's static page generation to render the content from Notion. This way, we don't hit the API threshold, and as an (intended) bonus, it makes the site fast to navigate.",

                Besides writing code and blog posts, I am also passionate about
                creating music (I play many instruments, but the guitar is my
                weapon of choice). On the weekends, you'll find me playing games
                with friends or hacking on one of my many side projects.

                During some of my working hours, I like to stream on Twitch. I
                have been working remotely for the best part of my professional
                life, and I always loved co-working with people who were
                streaming. So, at the end of last year, I decided to start{' '}
